Yt::Auth - authenticate users with their Google account
=======================================================

Yt::Auth helps you write apps that need to authenticate users by means of their Google account.

The **source code** is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/fullscreen/yt-auth) and the **documentation** on [RubyDoc](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/yt-auth/frames).

The Yt::Auth library provides two methods: `url` and `email`.

Yt::Auth#url
------------

With the `url` method, you can obtain a URL where to redirect users who need to
authenticate with their Google account in order to use your application:

```ruby
redirect_uri = 'https://example.com/auth' # REPLACE WITH REAL ONE
Yt::Auth.new(redirect_uri: redirect_uri).url
 # => https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?client_id=...&scope=email&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fauth&response_type=code
```

Yt::Auth#email
--------------

After users have authenticated with their Google account, they will be
redirected to the `redirect_uri` you indicated, with an extra `code` query
parameter, e.g. `https://example.com/auth?code=1234`

With the `email` method, you can obtain the verified email of the users:

```ruby
redirect_uri = 'https://example.com/auth' # REPLACE WITH REAL ONE
code = '1234' # REPLACE WITH REAL ONE
Yt::Auth.new(redirect_uri: redirect_uri, code: code).email
 # => "user@example.com"
```

Yt::AuthError
-------------

`Yt::AuthError` will be raised whenever something goes wrong during the
authentication process. The message of the error will include the details:

```ruby
redirect_uri = 'https://example.com/auth' # REPLACE WITH REAL ONE
code = 'this-is-not-a-valid-code'
Yt::Auth.new(redirect_uri: redirect_uri, code: code).email
 # => Yt::AuthError: Invalid authorization code.
```
